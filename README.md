# art-project
this is a form of image scrambler, basically 
what it will do is read what shade of each color each pixel 
of the image is then change it to 
a solid color, which in this case is either red, green or blue. 
You can change the gap that the shade of color has to be within to get diffrent 
effects, i used this in art class so i wasnt bored out of my mind drawing 

this was made in proccesing using java
